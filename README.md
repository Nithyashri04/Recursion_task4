Recursion is a technique in which a method calls itself to solve a problem. In the given example:

Base Case: The factorial method has a base case where if n is 0, it returns 1. This prevents infinite recursion and serves as the stopping condition.

Recursive Case: The method computes the factorial by multiplying the current number n with the factorial of n-1, effectively breaking the problem into smaller instances of itself.

Execution Flow: Starting with n=5, the method calls itself with decreasing values of n until the base case is reached. The results are then multiplied as the stack "unwinds" to produce the final result.
